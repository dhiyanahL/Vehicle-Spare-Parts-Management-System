# Vehicle-Spare-Parts-Management-System
This project was developed using the MVC architecture, with Java being the primary programming language.
Devloped over the course of Year 2 - Semester 2 as an assignment for the Object Oriented Programming module, I developed the CRUD operations for the Seller role.

My CRUD operation as the Seller was to :-

a)CREATE a Seller profile

b)READ the Seller profile

c)UPDATE the Seller profile

d)DELETE the Seller profile
